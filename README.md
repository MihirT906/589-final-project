## Running the Neural Network Evaluations
All neural network code is self-contained and can be found in the folder `./neural_network`. 


To run the code, simply run the following **with** `./neural_network` **as the working directory:**

```console
$ python nn_eval.py
```

Model performances are outputted to the terminal and figures are saved to `./neural_network/figures/`.

### Prerequisites:
`Python >= 3.10` is required to run the neural network evaluations. 

Dependencies:
 - scikit-learn
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
